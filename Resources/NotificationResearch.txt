Doliński, D. (2016). Techniques of social influence : the psychology of gaining compliance. Routledge.
The above book details various social influence techniques when making requests. Looking at the table of contents, I will pick out various techniques that would be most effective in our application.
  

        In our application, we should consider the following:
* Using the name of one’s interlocutor 
   * Research: The book describes several studies wherein people tend to favor those who remember and use their names often. People are more receptive to salesmen who use their names. People are often put into a good mood when their name is used, which makes them open to suggestions. People also tend to have a more favorable opinion of those (in this study, professors) who make it a point to remember and use their name.
   * Takeaway: In our application, our notifications should address the user by their first name. Ex: “Hey Lisa! Have you drank enough water today?” “Good job, Lisa! Keep it up!”
* Induction of hypocrisy 
   * Research: The book details that “At the beginning of the 1990s, Elliot Aronson, Carrie Fried and Jeff Stone (1991) described a technique that they termed ‘induction of hypocrisy’, which is based on inducing individuals to understand clearly that their behavior is inconsistent with their public declarations. Such an observation of one’s own hypocrisy and inconsistency in behavior is an unpleasant experience, and motivates people to behave in a manner befitting of their previous public statements.” The book then goes on to describe various studies proving the fact that people, when called out on their hypocrisy, tend to change their behavior to match their stated values or actions.
   * Takeaway: In our application, we will follow this pattern. Stage one of this induction; the public stating of ideals and goals, will be introduced in the setup of the application. Users will be asked for their health goals, and an estimate of how much they believe that they currently follow these goals. Then, the notifications will come in that align with these chosen goals. For example, if a user claims that they do not like drinking an excess of alcohol at football games, and also claims that they currently do not drink an excess of alcohol, the notifications tailored to drinking will appear and will “confront” this reality. The application will remind the user not to drink too much, and the user will log whether or not they have followed this suggestion. This will force the user to confront their reality vs their claims.
* Please -- Is it always the magic word?
   * Research: The book discusses that it is obviously important to be polite when making a suggestion or request, and that studies have shown this to help results. The book also discusses the idea of being overly polite in ways that can change the meaning of requests and actually make a suggestion less effective.
   * Takeaway: Our notifications should be polite, but not overly so. They should be more of a statement than a polite request. For example, would “Lisa, please remember to drink water!” or “Remember to drink water, Lisa!” be more efficient?
* Even a penny will help
   * Research: The book discusses the phenomenon of asking for very little making it more likely for more people to respond to the request.
   * Takeaway: In our application, we can utilize this in our user’s health journey. Even if a health goal is to avoid eating unhealthy foods completely, a notification can make allowances for small progresses made in this goal. For example, at the end of the day the application could say “Hey Lisa, you’ve made some great progress on your food goals today! <insert statistic here>.”
